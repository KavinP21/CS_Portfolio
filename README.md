### Crop Disease Detection
- Description:
  
As part of my independent project, I have developed a robust and efficient Crop Disease Detection Module. This module employs machine learning techniques to detect and predict diseases in crops, contributing to early disease management in agriculture.
- Key Features:
Data Integration: The module seamlessly integrates data from multiple sources, including real-time IoT sensors placed in agricultural fields, historical disease datasets, and relevant weather conditions.
Machine Learning Models: I have designed and implemented machine learning models, utilizing algorithms such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Random Forest, to analyze the integrated data. These models are trained to identify patterns and correlations associated with various crop diseases.
Accurate Disease Detection: The module excels in accurate disease detection, helping farmers identify diseases at an early stage. This early detection enables timely intervention, reducing the spread of diseases and minimizing crop losses.
Customizable Alerts: The module can generate customizable alerts, notifying farmers when disease risks are detected, allowing for rapid response and disease management.
- Technologies Used:
Python
Java
Android Studio
PyTorch
OpenCV
