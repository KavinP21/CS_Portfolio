### Crop Disease Detection
- Description:
  
As part of my independent project, I have developed a robust and efficient Crop Disease Detection Module. This module employs machine learning techniques to detect and predict diseases in crops, contributing to early disease management in agriculture.

- Key Features:
  
Data Integration: The module seamlessly integrates data from multiple sources, including real-time IoT sensors and historical data of plant images.

Machine Learning Models: I have designed and implemented machine learning models, utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Random Forest, to analyze the integrated data. These models are trained to identify patterns and correlations associated with various crop diseases.

Accurate Disease Detection: The module excels in accurate disease detection, helping farmers identify diseases at an early stage. This early detection enables timely intervention, reducing the spread of diseases and minimizing crop losses.

- Technologies Used:
   
Python

Java

Android Studio

PyTorch

OpenCV

Scikit-Learn

TensorFlow

IoT Sensor Data Integration

CNNs

Firebase

- Results:
  
The Crop Disease Detection Module has shown impressive results in its ability to detect diseases accurately and promptly as it has a 99.46% validation accuracy and a loss of 0.0190. It provides farmers with actionable insights to make informed decisions about disease management. By reducing the reliance on chemical treatments and minimizing crop losses, it contributes to improved crop health and overall yield.
